# AlexaHelloWorld
This project was created as a HttpTrigger - C<span>#</span> Azure Function project.


## How it works

This is a simple Alexa Skill POC that when launched on the Echo says "What up, dude? Do you know how much Dad Rocks?" 
I created it to learn how to create a Skill hosted in Azure Functions, and also to harrass my kids.
