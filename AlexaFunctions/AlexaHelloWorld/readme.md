# AlexaHelloWorld
This project was created as a HttpTrigger - C<span>#</span> Azure Function project.

This is a simple Alexa Skill POC that when launched on the Echo says "What up, dude? Do you know how much Dad Rocks?" 
I created it to learn how to create a Skill hosted in Azure Functions, and also to harass my kids.


## How it works
Details on setting up this solution can be found on a post: [Alexa on Azure: Part 1- Creating the Function](http://intranoggin.com/Blog/February-2017/Alexa-on-Azure-Part-1-Creating-the-Function.aspx "Alexa on Azure: Part 1- Creating the Function") and on this post: [Alexa on Azure: Part 2 – Registering Your Function](http://intranoggin.com/Blog/February-2017/Alexa-on-Azure-Part-2–Registering-Your-Function.aspx "Alexa on Azure: Part 2 – Registering Your Function")

### Update 4/20/2017
I marked the function as disabled in the function.json file. If you want to test this function out, make sure you change that setting to true before publishing.
