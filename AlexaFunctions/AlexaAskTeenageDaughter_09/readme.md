# Alexa Ask Teenage Daughter

This is the current verison of the Alexa Skill, Ask Teenage Daughter. 

The skill is written in C# and hosted on Azure Functions. 

The creation of this skill is described on [Intranoggin.com](http://intranoggin.com "Blog") over several articles released beginning in February, 2017.



### Update 4/20/2017
Going forward, I'm combining the functionality from both the Alexa Ask Teenage Son and Alexa Ask Teenage Daughter skills into a single AlexaAskTeenager skill.
Further information on how that works will be found in the readme file in that directory.

I marked the function as disabled in the function.json file. If you want to test this function out, make sure you change that setting to true before publishing.
