# Alexa Ask Teenage Son

This is the current verison of the Alexa Skill, Ask Teenage Son. In general this is the equal opportunity version of the AskTeenageDaughter skill and most of the documentation for that skill applies to this one as well.

The skill is written in C# and hosted on Azure Functions. 

This skill is the equal opportunity version of the Ask Teenage Daughter skill, the creation of which is described on [http://intranoggin.com](http://intranoggin.com "Blog")Intranoggin.com over several articles released beginning in February, 2017.



### Update 4/20/2017
Going forward, I'm combining the functionality from both the Alexa Ask Teenage Son and Alexa Ask Teenage Daughter skills into a single AlexaAskTeenager skill.
Further information on how that works will be found in the readme file in that directory.

I marked the function as disabled in the function.json file. If you want to test this function out, make sure you change that setting to true before publishing.
