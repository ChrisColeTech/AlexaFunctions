# AlexaFunctions 
This is where I'll be hosting any open source Alexa Skills that I develop as Azure Functions. 

## AlexaHelloWorld
POC using C# Function.
 
Details on setting up this solution can be found on a post: [Alexa on Azure: Part 1- Creating the Function](http://intranoggin.com/Blog/January-2017/Alexa-on-Azure-Part-1-Creating-the-Function.aspx "Alexa on Azure: Part 1- Creating the Function")

## AlexaAskTeenageDaughter.05
This is the first version of the Ask Teenage Daughter skill and is a demonstration of using Slots and multiple Intents in an Alexa Skill. The current version is at AlexaAskTeenageDaughter, but this version goes with the blog post [Alexa on Azure: Part 3 - Adding Slots](http://intranoggin.com/Blog/February-2017/Alexa-on-Azure-Part-3-Adding-Slots.aspx "Alexa on Azure: Part 3 - Adding Slots")

## AlexaAskTeenageDaughter
The current version of this skill. The lessons I've learned along the way are chronicled on [Intranoggin.com](http://intranoggin.com "Blog")

## AlexaAskTeenageSon
The equal opportunity version of the AlexaAskTeenageDaughter skill

## AlexaKeepAlive
This is a simple timer trigger function that calls the http functions every 15 minutes.
